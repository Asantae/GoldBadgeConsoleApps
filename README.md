# GoldBadgeConsoleApps
Contains 3 functional projects. First one being the KomodoMenu, which is a project that allows the user to add, delete or display all items to a fictional menu.
The second of these projects is komodoClaims. This project allows the user to display all claims, attend to the next claim, and enter a new claim.
The third is komodoInsurance. This project allows the user to add employee badges, update employee badges, and see all badges. These badges give employees acces to different doors
within the fictional workspace. 
Each of these projects are carried out from the console and independant of one another. Each project has its own series of tests to check on functionality.
